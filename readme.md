# Portfolio Site

This is the source code for a website created to primarily serve as my portfolio and a place to showcase my work. I also use it as a place to write about my experiences and share my thoughts on various topics. It was also a great way to learn React and get more familiar with the JavaScript ecosystem. It can be found at [www.tulxoro.me](www.tulxoro.me).

## Environment

This site is created using create-react-app. As such, it is a React app. It also uses the following libraries: [MaterialUI](www.mui.com), and [React Router](www.reactrouter.com).

## Running the site

I have included a `package.json` file, so you can run the site locally by running `npm install` and then `npm start`. This will run the site on `localhost:3000`. I would prefer that you do not use this site for your own portfolio, but if you do, please make sure to change the `package.json` file to reflect your own information.
